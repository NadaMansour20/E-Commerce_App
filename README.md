<h1>E-Commerce App</h1>

ðŸ“± The app is powered by the MVVM architecture, ensuring clean and maintainable code. Iâ€™ve integrated APIs for dynamic content and used Room Database extensively for key functionalities:</br>

User Registration & Login: User data is securely stored in the Room Database, which checks if an account exists during registration.</br>
Favorites & Cart Management: Users can save their favorite products and add items to their cart, with all data efficiently managed locally.</br>
Product Search: The app includes a powerful search feature, allowing users to quickly find products within the app.</br>
